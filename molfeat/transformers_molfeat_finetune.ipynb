    "### Introduction: MolFeat on the IPU\n",
    "\n",
    "The popular [MolFeat Library](https://molfeat.datamol.io) offers a comprehensive open-source collection of pre-trained featurizers for molecules, designed for seamless integration into ML workflows. \n",
    "The pre-trained featurizers in the Molfeat library have been trained on large quantities of data from a variety of domains, making them ideally suited to providing an initial featurization on new molecular datasets. This makes it possible to use larger and more sophisticated models even when only very small datasets are available as the fundamental physical properties of the molecule are already represented in the featurizer. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we present a step-by-step guide on how to employ the Graphcore IPU for fine-tuning a pre-trained Transformer model on the `Blood-Brain Barrier Permeability (BBBP)` dataset from MoleculeNet. The goal is to predict which molecules can cross the blood-brain barrier, an essential property for drug development. Additionally, we demonstrate the versatility of this method for other regression tasks using new datasets.\n",

    "### Learning Outcomes\n",
    "Through this demo, you will acquire the skills to:\n",
    "- Classify molecules by leveraging a MolFeat featurizer and fine-tuning a Hugging Face Transformer on the IPU.\n",
    "- Construct an inference workflow for individual molecule predictions.\n",
    "- Understand how to transition between classification and regression tasks.\n",

Imagine we have a dataset of molecules that we know something about, in this case about the ability of various compounds to penetrate the Blood-Brain-Barrier, but it could be any property we wish. This dataset has been made from experimental results which is ultimately very expensive and time consuming to collect and extend. \n",

    "\n",
    "The AwesomeNet model is a custom PyTorch neural network architecture that utilizes a pre-trained transformer model from the Molfeat library as the base for molecule featurization. The architecture is comprised of several layers and components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Embedding Layer**: A copy of the base pre-trained transformer model from the MolFeat featurizer, which serves as the embedding layer for the input data.\n",
    "2. **Embedding Dimension**: The size of the hidden layer in the base pre-trained transformer model.\n",
    "3. **Pooling Layer**: Obtained from the MolFeat featurizer, this layer performs pooling operations on the embeddings.\n",
    "4. **Hidden Layer**: A sequential layer consisting of dropout, linear, and ReLU activation layers. The input size is the length of the MolFeat featurizer, while the output size is a user-defined `hidden_size`.\n",
    "5. **Output Layer**: A linear layer that maps the hidden layer's output to the final output size, which is usually set to 1 for regression tasks.\n",
    "6. **Loss Function**: The model uses the Binary Cross Entropy with Logits Loss (BCEWithLogitsLoss) function to compute the loss during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `forward` function of the model takes input arguments and optional target labels (y) and performs the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Pass the input data through the embedding layer to obtain the embeddings.\n",
    "2. Extract the last hidden state from the embeddings.\n",
    "3. Apply the pooling layer on the last hidden state using the input_ids and attention_mask.\n",

    "5. Obtain the final output by passing the hidden layer's output through the output layer.\n",
